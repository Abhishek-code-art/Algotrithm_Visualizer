# Algo-Visualizer
**Algorithm Visualizer**

**Sorting Algorithms:**
Immerse yourself in the sorting process through the metaphor of organizing books in a library. The objective is to alphabetically sort all the books. Users have the flexibility to choose from algorithms such as Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Insertion Sort, and Quick Sort. Tailor the visualization to your preference by adjusting the speed, the number of books, and explore worst-case scenarios.

**Path Finding Algorithms:**
Embark on a journey through drawable mazes to visualize the pathfinding process. Begin with a blank canvas, allowing users to draw the maze, set start and end points, and witness the pathfinding algorithm in action. Choose from algorithms like Depth First Search, Breadth First Search, and Dijkstra's algorithm, adjusting the visualization speed to match your preference.

**File Compression:**
Delve into the world of data compression with our visualizer. Witness the intricate process of file compression through the lens of Huffman Encoding. Gain insights into optimal data representation, offering a clear understanding of how this compression technique efficiently reduces file sizes. Users can control the visualization speed, providing an educational experience in the principles of data compression.

This Algorithm Visualizer provides an interactive and customizable experience, offering dynamic insights into sorting, various pathfinding algorithms, and file compression techniques. Explore real-world scenarios, making learning both engaging and effective.
