<h1>A quick tutorial on generating a huffman tree</h1>

Lets say you have a set of numbers and their frequency of use and want 
to create a huffman encoding for them:
<pre>
	<b>FREQUENCY</b>	<b>VALUE</b>
        ---------       -----
       	     5            1
             7            2
            10            3
            15            4
            20            5
            45            6
</pre>
Creating a huffman tree is simple.  Sort this list by frequency and
make the two-lowest elements into leaves, creating a parent node
with a frequency that is the sum of the two lower element's frequencies:
<pre>
    	12:*
    	/  \
      5:1   7:2
</pre>
The two elements are removed from the list and the new parent node,
with frequency 12, is inserted into the list by frequency.  So now the 
list, sorted by frequency, is:
<pre>
        10:3
        12:*
        15:4
        20:5
        45:6
</pre>
You then repeat the loop, combining the two lowest elements. This results in:
<pre>
    	22:*
    	/   \
     10:3   12:*
     	    /   \
	  5:1   7:2
</pre>
and the list is now:
<pre>
	15:4
	20:5
	22:*
	45:6
</pre>
You repeat until there is only one element left in the list.  
<pre>
    	35:*
    	/   \
      15:4  20:5

      	22:*
      	35:*
      	45:6

      	    57:*
      	___/    \___
       /            \
     22:*          35:*
    /   \          /   \
 10:3   12:*     15:4   20:5
        /   \
      5:1   7:2

	45:6
	57:*

                                   102:*
                __________________/    \__
               /                          \
      	    57:*                         45:6
      	___/    \___
       /            \
     22:*          35:*
    /   \          /   \
 10:3   12:*     15:4   20:5
        /   \
      5:1   7:2
</pre>
Now the list is just one element containing 102:*, you are done.
<p>
This element becomes the root of your binary huffman tree.  To generate
a huffman code you traverse the tree to the value you want, outputing
a <b>0</b> every time you take a lefthand branch, and a <b>1</b> every time you
take a righthand branch.  (normally you traverse the tree backwards
from the code you want and build the binary huffman encoding string
backwards as well, since the <i>first</i> bit must start from the top).
<p>
<b>Example</b>:  The encoding for the value <b>4</b> (15:4) is <b>010</b>.  
The encoding for the value <b>6</b> (45:6) is <b>1</b>
<p>
Decoding a huffman encoding is just as easy : as you read bits in
from your input stream you traverse the tree beginning at the root,
taking the left hand path if you read a <b>0</b> and the right hand path
if you read a <b>1</b>.  When you hit a leaf, you have found the code.
<p>
Generally, any huffman compression scheme also requires the huffman
tree to be written out as part of the file, otherwise the reader cannot
decode the data.  For a static tree, you don't have to do this since
the tree is known and fixed.
<p>
The easiest way to output the huffman tree itself is to, starting at
the root, dump first the left hand side then the right hand side.
For each node you output a <b>0</b>, for each leaf you output a <b>1</b> 
followed by N bits representing the value.  For example, the partial tree in
my last example above using 4 bits per value can be represented as
follows:

<pre>
  <b>000100</b> fixed 6 bit byte indicates how many bits the <i>value</i>
         for each leaf is stored in.  In this case, 4.
  <b>0</b>      root is a node
         left hand side is
  <b>10011</b>  a leaf with value 3
         right hand side is
  <b>0</b>      another node
         recurse down, left hand side is
  <b>10001</b>  a leaf with value 1
         right hand side is
  <b>10010</b>  a leaf with value 2
         recursion return
</pre>
So the partial tree can be represented with <b>00010001001101000110010</b>, 
or 23 bits.  Not bad!
